title="Enabling Keycloak Health checks"
summary="Learn how to enable and use Keycloak health checks"
includedOptions="health-enabled">

Keycloak has built in support for health checks. This guide describes how to enable and use the Keycloak health checks.

== Keycloak Health checks

Keycloak exposed health endpoints are three:

* `/health`
* `/health/live`
* `/health/ready`

The result is returned in json format and it looks as follows:
[source, json]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": []
}
----

== Enabling the health checks
Is possible to enable the health checks using the build time option `health-enabled`:

<@kc.build parameters="--health-enabled=true"/>

By default, no check is returned from the health endpoints.

== Available Checks

The table below shows the available checks.

|===
|*Check* | *Description* | *Requires Metrics*

|Database
|Returns the status of the database connection pool.
|Yes

|===

For some checks, you'll need to also enable metrics as indicated by the `Requires Metrics` column. To enable metrics
use the `metrics-enabled` option as follows:

<@kc.build parameters="--health-enabled=true --metrics-enabled=true"/>

== Using http-relative-path and the health endpoints
When you use Keycloak exposed under a different path than the root path `/`, make sure you set the `http-relative-path` variable with a leading Slash (`/`) for the endpoints to work correctly.

.Working example
<@kc.start parameters="--http-relative-path=/auth --health-enabled=true --metrics-enabled=true"/>

Without the leading slash, the endpoints won't work correctly.
